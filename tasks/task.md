## Task

Write a Python function `group_by_length(words)` that takes a list of strings and returns a dictionary where:

- The keys are the lengths of the words.
- The values are lists of words that have that length.
- The order of words must remain the same as in the original list.

### Example

Input:
["cat", "dog", "apple"]

Output:
{3: ["cat", "dog"], 5: ["apple"]}
